|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|After the initial release of the WCM document for Trial Implementation    |
|numerous issues were discovered, which resulted in a major edit of the    |
|document.                                                                 |


Major changes include:

    • Various - Changed title to Waveform Content Module from Waveform
      Communications Message

    • X.Y.2.1 - Scheme for optimization of waveform data transmission which
      allows reuse of attributes

    • X.Y.3 - Use of the OBR segment to group waveforms

    • X.Y.3 - Handling of continuous as well as time-bounded waveforms

Changes are distributed througout the document.  Specific changes are too
numerous to be ennumerated in this CP.  We recommend reviewing the changes
in the document itself through the use of the Microsoft Word Review
functionality (track changes were on for all edits.)
