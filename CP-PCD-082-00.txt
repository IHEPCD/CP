|The subsection for OBX-4 Sub-Id in section B.8 explains the order for     |
|metric observations, but does not mention device-related segments, so an  |
|explanation of order for device-related segments is added.                |


Insert the following paragraph after line 1855:

This ‘dictionary order’ should also be applied to device-related as well as
to metric OBX segments: all MDS device-related segments for the first
device should precede all VMD device-related segments for the first VMD of
the first device, which in turn should precede any channel device-related
segment(s) for the first channel, if any, of the first device (recall that
channels are optional), and any channel segments should precede all the
metric OBX segments of the first VMD and channel of the first device. The
the order goes to the second channel of the first VMD if any, and so on
until the contents of all the channels of the first VMD have been given,
then device-related segments for the second VMD, and so on in a similar
fashion. (This is in effect a depth-first traversal of the 11073
“containment tree” of the objects in the device).
