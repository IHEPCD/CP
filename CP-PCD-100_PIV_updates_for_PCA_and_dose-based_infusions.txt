Note: red font indicates proposed text.


Volume 1 – Glossary
Proposed:
Add the following definitions:
PCA - patient controlled analgesia; used to refer to an infusion device
which is specialized for the delivery of PCA therapy
LVP – large volume pump; a general purpose infusion device which can
deliver medications contained in a bag, bottle, or other container
Syringe pump – an infusion device which is specialized for the delivery of
medications contained in a syringe

Volume 2
Section 3.3 PCD-03 Communicate Infusion Order
Current text:
Note: see related detail on infusion pump device models and data models in
the Device Specialization – Infusion Pump
PCD profiles for large volume pumps, syringe pumps and patient controlled
analgesia.

PCD profiles for large volume, syringe, and patient controlled analgesia
(PCA) pumps.

Current text:

Definition: This field contains the numeric portion of the rate or dose to
be administered. If the infusion requires a dosed value, such as dopamine
at 5 mcg/kg/min, this field contains the dose value amount (e.g., “5"). If
it does not, such as normal saline at 75 mL/hr, then this field contains
the rate value (e.g., "75").

Proposed text:
Definition: This field contains the numeric portion of the rate, dose rate,
or dose amount to be administered.
If the infusion order specifies a rate, such as normal saline at 75 mL/hr,
then this field contains the rate value amount (e.g., "75").
If the infusion order specifies a dose rate, such as dopamine at 5
mcg/kg/min, this field contains the dose rate value amount (e.g., “5").
If the infusion order specifies a dose amount, such as 2 g, this field
contains the dose value amount (e.g. “2”).

Definition: This field contains the coded version of the units portion of
the rate or dose to be administered. If the infusion requires a dosed
value, such as dopamine at 5 mcg/kg/min, this field represents the dose
units (e.g., "mcg/kg/min"). If it does not, such as normal saline at 75
mL/hr, then this field represents the rate units (e.g., "mL/hr"). The
preferred format is an MDC value; UCUM values are also acceptable.

Examples:

265266^MDC_DIM_MILLI_L_PER_HR^MDC
265619^MDC_DIM_MICRO_G_PER_KG_PER_MIN^MDC

the rate, dose rate, or dose to be administered.
If the infusion order specifies a rate, such as normal saline to infuse at
75 mL/hr, this field represents the rate units (e.g., "mL/hr").

"mcg/kg/min").
If the infusion order specifies a dose, such as ceftriaxone 2 g, this field
represents the dose units (e.g. “g”).
When a dose is specified the TQ1 segment must be present to indicate the

3.3.4.4.9 OBX - Observation/Result segment
Current text:

Refer to HL7 v2.6: Section 7.4.2

The HL7 OBX segment is used to transmit a single observation or observation
fragment. In the Point-of-Care Infusion Verification Profile the usage is
limited to (1) providing the Device ID that will be used by the Infusion
Order Consumer and (2) providing patient height, weight, or Body Surface
Area (BSA) information from the Infusion Order Programmer to the Infusion
Order Consumer. Note that the definition of the OBX segment in this profile
is constrained from the definition used in the PCD Observation/Result
Message to reflect this limited usage. The broader definition can be found
in Error: Reference source not found, Appendix Section B-8.

One OBX segment containing the Device ID must always be present. One to
three additional OBX segments containing the patient height and/or patient
weight and/or patient BSA may optionally follow.

OBX-18 Equipment Instance Identifier
Current text:

See Appendix Section B.8 for description of usage of OBX-18.

For backward compatibility, the OBX-18 convention used in previous Trial
Implementation versions of the Point-of-Care Infusion Verification
Supplement may be used by agreement between sending and receiving systems,
but this usage is deprecated and should not be used in new systems. The
former language is reproduced here: "If OBX-3 refers to the pump ID, the ID
is placed in the ‘Universal ID’ component (EI-3), and the device or
manufacturer name is placed in the ‘Universal ID Type’ component (EI-4).
The pump ID is a unique alphanumeric identifier and may optionally include
the pump channel. The format of the identifier is vendor-specific. A
typical value could be a serial number for a single-channel pump, or a
serial number followed by the channel number or letter for a multi-channel
pump. Note that this specification differs from the usage of OBX-18 in IHE
PCD DEC profiles."

New applications should conform to the general specification for OBX-18
(Appendix section B.8). The pump ID (vendor-specific format, which may
optionally include the pump channel as before) should be placed in EI-1,
and EI-3 and EI-4 should identify the manufacturer of the pump according to
an accepted Universal ID system.

If OBX-3 refers to weight or height, this field must be empty.

Expected Actions

Current text:
Once the programming information is received by the pump, the clinician may
choose to do one of the following: (1) confirm the settings on the pump and
then start the infusion, (2) enter or modify one or more settings and then
start the infusion, or (3) cancel the program altogether.

choose to do one of the following: (1) confirm the settings on the pump and

Updates to Pump Error Codes

Proposed:

Comment - Program rejected by user prior to starting infusion

Update Description for error code 9016
Current:  “Unknown error”
Proposed: "Other error"
