|A number of updates have been identified for the IPEC profile since it was|

|Add an Editor’s Note box to the beginning of te document indicating that  |
|the infusion pump content is being migrated to the device specialization  |
|profiles and that this profile will be morphed into an Event Communication|
|(EC) profile at some point.                                               |
|Online/offline behavior – expected behaviour for a DOR is to buffer events|
|that occur while the system is offline, and then upload them when it      |
|returns back on-line.                                                     |
|Add new events (e.g., Clear Volume Counters)                              |
|Misc. edits based on decisions made during infusion pump working group    |
|discussions.                                                              |
|                                                                          |


Add the following section BEFORE Introduction:



[pic]



Change the following Table X.1.2.1-4 Clinical Scenarios:

(Table Column Heading)  Required Parameters





Add the following to the end of 3.Y.4.1:

Event messages are generated by the infusion pump or Gateway during normal
execution of an infusion therapy. Example of such events are start of
infusion delivery, rate change or transition from piggyback to primary or
transition to KVO. This information is sent from a DOR to a DOC.

Note that while a system is off-line, all events should be buffered and
then communicated when communication is established again.  Event time
stamps should indicate when the event occurred, not when it was
communicated.



Insert the following in Table X.1.2-1:

-----------------------

EDITORS NOTE:  With the specification of Device Specialization – Infusion
Pump profiles, it is anticipated that the pump-specific content of this
IPEC profile will be migrated to these infusion pump content
specifications.  As a result, in a future cycle, this profile shall be
generalized to Event Communication (EC) and will provide a general
capability – using the defined PCD-10 transaction – to support all device
EC.
