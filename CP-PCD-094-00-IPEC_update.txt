EDITORS NOTE: With the specification of Device Specialization – Infusion
Pump profiles, it is anticipated that the pump-specific content of this
IPEC profile will be migrated to these infusion pump content
specifications. As a result, in a future cycle, this profile shall be
generalized to Event Communication (EC) and will provide a general
capability – using the defined PCD-10 transaction – to support all device
EC

Introduction


This Supplement adds sections to the PCD Technical Framework Volume 1
describing the content associated with communicating Infusion Pump device
events, and to Volume 2 describing data content and constraints.

Profile Abstract


The Infusion Pump Event Communication (IPEC) Profile specifies methods for
communicating significant clinical and technical events from a Patient Care
Device such as infusion pump to an information system which may present it
to a clinical user, acts on it in some way or records it. The information
is communicated in a data format similar to that of Device Enterprise
Communications (DEC) Profile, but differs in that DEC is mainly used for
sampled physiological and technical data at timed, equal intervals, while
IPEC is used to communicate significant occurrences which happen at
unscheduled times. Infusion Pump Event Communications is also related to
the AlertAlarm Communications Management (ACM) Profile, except that ACM is
designed to communicate alarms (physiological and technical) for
physiological alarms and technical alerts  advisories to a human actor via
portable devices, where IPEC is designed for system-to-system communication
for automated recording or tracking occurrences which do not necessarily
require urgent attention from a person.

Open Issues and Questions


 • For future considerations:

    • Include a unique event identifier in order to help in associating
      related events (delivery starts and delivery stops). Since there are
      many different use cases in pump operation, it may be that this is not
      feasible. Further analysis is needed. In the meantime this can be
      accomplished using patient, device and order identifiers that are
      present in the PCD-10 message.

    • Support for subscription option for event messages.

    • Harmonize Patient ID Change event with the Point of Care Identity
      Management (PCIM) work group.

    • Determine Containment level for optional events.

    • Possible alignment with the Pharmacy domain through the use of the
      RAS^O17 message instead of ORU^R42

Closed Issues


NoneContainment level defined for all events.

Add the following section to section 2.2

2.2.X Infusion Pump Event Communication Integration Profile


This document introduces a new profile - Infusion Pump Event Communication.
This profile is based on the general observation reporting in the Device
Enterprise Communication (DEC) Profile. Infusion Pump Event Communication
uses the same general form of interactions among Device Observation
Reporter and Device Observation Consumer actors.

The principal intended uses of IHE Device Enterprise Communication in acute
care are to communicate device data to enterprise information systems for:

 • Reporting, charting and trending physiological data to assist clinicians
   in tracking the patients physiological state for situational awareness
   and care planning

 • Near-real-time response to clinically or technically actionable events
   and situations

 • Provision of information for an archival record of device observations,
   possibly including events, that are clinical, technical, or both

Device Enterprise Communications (DEC) is chiefly designed for the first
goal listed based on periodic observation reporting, but has always
provided for episodic and event reporting as a subtype of general event
reporting.

This Infusion Pump Event Communication Integration Profile is designed to
address the second goal of reporting events, specifically infusion pumps
events. It defines a means for communicating significant events in
medication administration by infusion pumps.

Events in Medical Device Communications

An event, in the context of medical device communications, is an occurrence
about which it is desired to communicate information between devices and
information systems. Events are communicated as soon after their occurrence
as is technically feasible, in contrast to other observation reporting in
from devices to information systems which capture the trend of continuously-
varying physiological characteristics indicating the patient’s clinical
status by communicating observations an even time interval
characteristicsat regular time intervals. These characteristics are usually
then displayed to clinical users in a spreadsheet-like grid or on a trend
graph.

One special sort of event is an episodic measurement, that is, one that is
not automatically initiated on a regular, timed basis, such as a spot blood
pressure cuff reading, or a non-continuous cardiac output measurement.
These are initiated manually and the receiving information system has no
foreknowledge of when they will occur.

Another special case is an alert or alarm or advisory, where the key
outcome of the event alert is meant to be some action by a person. The IHE
PCD Alarm Alert Communication Management (ACM) profile is focused on the
human notification aspect of this.



Relation of Infusion Pump Event Communication to AlertAlarm Communication
Management (ACM) Profile

See the Glossary in Volume 1 of the PCD Technical Framework (PCD-TF1) for
definitions of the terms Advisory, Alarm, and Alert.

AlertAlarm Communication Management has provided expanded formats with
additional attributes for alarms and advisories, with emphasis on
transmitting the information to specific individuals who need to be
notified at the point of care via portable devices. This has been
supplemented by Waveform Communication profiling work which allows
associating waveform data with an alarm.

For purposes of this discussion, a distinction is made between events and
alertsalarms.

 • Events are operational milestones and key parameter changes.  For
   example, during normal execution of an infusion therapy, non-alarm
   conditions such as start of delivery, change of rate, switchover from
   piggyback to primary drug, completion of delivery, transition to KVO,
   etc. are important to full recording or state awareness for the
   therapeutic process.

 • Alarms are a subset ofAlerts, which are distinct from events which and
   are intended to engage immediate a response from the clinician, and are
   handled insupported by the Alarm Alert Communication Management profile.

Clinical information systems must communicate, for real-time high-
reliability review and action, and record for documentation purposes:

 • Exception Events – physiological or technical, which may indicate
   conditions either in the patient or in the equipment in use by those
   caring for the patient, which need attention at stated levels of urgency.
   These include alarms, appropriately processed for human notification
   using the Alarm Alert Communication Management profile, but may in
   addition need to be communicated to information systems for other
   purposes than immediate notification of persons, such as documentation.

 • State transitions – operationally significant changes between discrete
   states of physiological or technical conditions (for example, “modes” and
   “settings” for a device, “warning or alarm limit” or “action limit” for a
   measured physiological parameter).

 • Priority may be evaluated by the original sending device or by business
   rules and clinical protocols in downstream systems. Sources for raw and
   derived data and interpretations of priority must be documented for
   audit/forensic purposes, potentially by additions to content of message.

X.1 Actors/Transactions


Figure X.1-1 shows the actors directly involved in the Infusion Pump Event
Communication Integration Profile and the relevant transactions between
them.  Other actors that may be indirectly involved due to their
participation in Device Enterprise Communications (DEC) or Point-of-care
Infusion Verification (PIV), etc., are not necessarily shown.

X.4 Infusion Pump Event Communication Process Flow


X.4.1 Standard Use Cases


X.4.1.1 Case IPEC-1: Communicate event data to EMR/EHR


Data from all of the patient care devices associated with a particular
patient is communicated by a Gateway, Device or Clinical Information System
(CIS) implementing the DOR actor to an EMR/EHR, implementing the DOC actor.
This document only covers event data received from infusion pumps. Discrete
parameters representing the device’s state at or near the time of the event
are included. The data is time stamped with a consistent time across the
data from the respective patient care devices.

The primary intent is communication of structured data; however provisions
are made for inclusion of unstructured data. The application provides
facilities to bind an authoritative enterprise patient identifier required
for inclusion of the PCD data in the patient record.  The workflow for
associating the authoritative enterprise patient identifier to the PCD data
is outside the scope of the current PCD TF.

X.5 IPEC Security Considerations

The IPEC profile does not address issues of privacy, security, and
confidentiality associated with cross-enterprise communication of PCD data.
The assumption is made that the IPEC profile is implemented in a single
enterprise on a secure network.

            B: Appendix B Transaction Summary Definitions

Infusion Pump Event – An event, in the context of infusion pump device
communications, is an occurrence about which it is desired to communicate
information between Infusion Pump devices and Clinical Information Systems.
 For example, during normal execution of an infusion therapy, non-alarm
conditions such as start of delivery, change of rate, switchover from
piggyback to primary drug, completion of delivery, transition to KVO, etc.,
are important to full documentation of the IV administration.



Glossary

Add the following terms to the Glossary:

Event:  an occurrence about which it is desired to communicate information
between devices and information systems. Events include operational
milestones and key parameter changes.  Alarms are considered to be a subset
of events.

Program: Settings used to control the operation of the pump. A program
typically initiated by the clinician and entered manually on the device.
Once the settings are confirmed, the clinician can then start the infusion.

Auto Program: A pump program in which some or all settings are received
from another system such as an eMAR or BCMA system. When an auto-program is
received on the pump, the clinician will enter any additional required
settings, confirm them, and start the infusion.

Delivery: The infusion pump mechanism for moving fluid into a patient is
engaged.

KVO: Keep Vein Open. A fluid delivery mode that may occur once the
programmed volume has been infused.

3.Y Communicate Infusion Event Data


This section corresponds to the Communicate Infusion Event Data transaction
of the IHE Technical Framework. Communicate Infusion Event Data is used by
the DOR and DOC actors.

3.Y.1 Scope


This transaction is used to communicate infusion event data from:

 •  A Device Observation Reporter (DOR) to a Device Observation Consumer
   (DOC).



3.Y.2 Use Case Roles


[pic]

Actor: Device Observation Reporter

Role:  Sends infusion event data to DOC

Actor: Device Observation Consumer

Role:  Receives infusion event data from DOR



3.Y.3 Referenced Standard

    • ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature

    3.Y.4 Interaction Diagram































3.Y.4.1 Communicate Infusion Event Data


Event messages are generated by the infusion pump or Gateway during normal
execution of an infusion therapy. Example of such events are start of
infusion delivery, rate change or transition from piggyback to primary or
transition to KVO. This information is sent from a DOR to a DOC.

Note that while a system is off-line, all events should be buffered and
then communicated when communication is established again. Event time
stamps should indicate when the event occurred, not when it was
communicated.

3.Y.4.1.1 Trigger Events


The ORU^R42^ORU_R01 message is an unsolicited update initiated by the
Device Observation Reporter. The ORU^R42 can be sent with or without a
preceding order, since it is common in a clinical setting for device data
to be reported without a specific order having been transacted in the
information system (that is, the reporting is the result of a "standing
order" for monitoring in a particular clinical situation).

3.Y.4.1.2 Message Semantics


Refer to the HL7 standard for the ORU message of HL7 2.6 Chapter 7 and the
general message semantics.

The ORU^R42^ORU_R01 message structure provides the mechanisms for mapping
the hierarchical structure of an IEEE 11073 containment tree to a series of
OBX segments.messages each of which is optionally qualified by a note which
immediately follows the respective OBX. See the discussion of how the
containment is represented using a "dotted notation" in field OBX-4
Observation Sub-ID in the PCD Technical Framework  Vol. 2 Rev. 1.23.0
Appendix B, Section B.8.

See “ISO/IEEE Nomenclature mapping to HL7 OBX-3” in the PCD Technical
Framework Vol. 2 Rev. 1.23.0, Appendix A, Section A.1 section 3.3 ISO/IEEE
Nomenclature mapping to HL7 OBX-3 for further information on the mapping
rules.

3.Y.4.1.3 Expected Actions


The ORU^R42^ORU_R01 message is sent from the DOR to the DOC. Upon receipt
the DOC validates the message and responds with an acknowledgement as
defined in PCD Technical Framework Vol. 2 Rev. 1.23.0 Appendix G.1.1
Acknowledgment Modes.

            C: Appendix X Infusion Pump Events

This appendix is intended to provide background information to support a
mechanism for the transmission of event information for large volume
(general purpose) infusion pumps.  Common infusion modalities for these
pumps may include continuous, piggyback, bolus, multi-step, and
intermittent functionality.  Support for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
pumps and other types of pumps will be addressed at a later date.

A major challenge in reporting infusion pump events is that although pumps
are able to report programmed and operational parameters, they are
typically not “aware” of how or why they are being used clinically.  In
medical environments there are an enormous number of use cases for
administering an infusion using a pump.  Even a routine delivery of an
amount of fluid may involve several instances where the infusion is paused
or stopped and then restarted (either within seconds or after several hours
or more).  The infusion rate may be changed, or an alarm may cause the
infusion to stop until the alarm is addressed.  For various practical and
clinical reasons, the values programmed on the pump by the clinician may
not relate to the volume that the physician ordered, the actual volume of
the fluid container that was hung, or the rate at which the infusion was
ordered.

All current pump systems do not report event information the same way.  The
same information may be represented differently, or a different set of
information may be reported.  Information may be reported periodically or
episodically, but not in accordance with a common specification.

As a result, a decision has been made to standardize a small number of
basic operational events.   In combination with pump mode and status
information, these can be used to express the various key operational
components of an infusion over time.  Systems that receive event
information, such as eMAR or BCMA systems, have the clinical/medication
order information and will need to reconcile the reported operational
events with this information.

       X.1 Basic Infusion Events

It may be helpful to think of an infusion as a series of delivery segments,
each of which is bounded by one of the following events:

 • Delivery Start

 • Delivery Stop

 • Delivery Complete

There are also several other operational events not related to fluid
delivery:

 • Communication Status Change – communication between pump and gateway is
   lost or resumed

 • Program Cleared – pump settings are cleared (indicating that a new
   program will be initiated)

 • Auto-Program Cleared – an auto-program was received on the pump but the
   programmed settings were cleared on the pump prior to starting delivery

 • Patient ID Change

 • Patient Weight Change

The following diagram illustrates a typical scenario where a bag of fluid
is infused and a rate change is made:

 • An infusion is started at 75 mL/hr.  A volume to be infused is programmed
   (not shown).

 • After a period of time the infusion is stopped (paused), perhaps in order
   to move the patient.

 • The infusion is resumed at 100 mL/hr.

 • The programmed volume to be infused is met (delivery is complete).

 • Pump switches to KVO (keep vein open) mode.

 • Pump is stopped.

       X.1.1 Event Message – PCD-10 Communicate Infusion Event Data

The structure of the message differs from the PCD-01 message (ORU^R01) in
the following ways

 • MSH-9.2 contains a new trigger event code (R42) assigned for infusion
   event data.

 • MSH-21.3 contains the PCD-10 unique profile identifier. The OID
   identifier assigned to PCD-10 is “1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.6.1.10.1”

Each PCD-10 message contains only information relevant to the specific
device and channel on which the event occurred. Each PCD-10 message
contains a single event. Only information pertinent to the event is
included.

       X.1.2.1 Infusion Event Parameters

Infusion Event Parameters are defined in separate Infusion Pump Model and
Infusion Pump Terms documents.  Current versions of these documents can be
found on the IHE Patient Care Devices Wiki page entitled “PCD Reference
Pages” (http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Category:PCD_Reference_Pages).

The following parameters will be used when reporting infusion events.

The following table describes the mapping of clinical scenarios to pump
events.  The term “delivery segment” refers to the period between a
MDCX_EVT_PUMP_DELIV_START event and the next MDCX_EVT_PUMP_DELIV_STOP or
MDCX_EVT_PUMP_DELIV_COMP event.

   Note: Additional clinical scenarios will be added to this table as they
         are identified.
