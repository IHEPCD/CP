The current  PCD TF document makes a strong recommendation that systems use
an EUI-64 Universal Identifier to identify the systems that the data
originates from.  During discussions in previous years and again at the
North American Connectathon on January 2014, and again at the IHE PCD Face
to Face meetings in April 2014 it was discussed that there needs to be more
than a strong recommendation that IHE PCD compliant systems use a EUI-64
Universal Identifier.

Discussions within those venues has resulted in an appraoch beibng proposed
in the CP where any system running in a Production environment should be
required to use a EUI-64 Universal Identifier.  Systems not running in a
Production environment (operating at testing venues such as Connectathon,
certification excercises, test labs, etc) will be allowed to use a EUI-64
Universal Identifier, but also an OID or URI approach can be taken as well.



The following updates to the TF document is being proposed to document this
slightly stronger position of requiring a EUI-64 Universal Identifier and
when it is required.





Replace the sentence in section C.5 as follows:

Original Text:

In IHE PCD, the order of preference for systems of Universal ID is: EUI-64,
OID, URI, and last DNS (Domain Name Service).



Proposed new text:

In IHE PCD, the order of preference for systems of Universal ID is: EUI-64,
OID and URI.  In addition to this order of preference it is noted that any
IHE PCD system running in a production environment shall only use a EUI-64
Universal ID.  Systems running in test environments or certification
environments are allowed to use an OID or URI Universal ID





Strike the following text from section C.5

Identifying with a DNS name. When the assigning authority is an information
system or a manufacturer, it is acceptable to use a Domain Name Service
name that uniquely identifies it. An IP address is a form of DNS, so it is
also acceptable. These are less stable and permanent than the other Unique
ID systems, which is why they are the least preferred.
