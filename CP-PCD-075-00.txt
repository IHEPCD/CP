|Integration Profile(s) affected:    |RTM Content Module                  |

|Supplement modified:                |                                    |
|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:  |Primarily TF-3, section 4 (which is |
|                                    |reserved for RTM)                   |
|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|Though the Rosetta Terminology Mapping (RTM) constrained data set is      |
|mandatory for all PCD transaction content, the detailed specification     |
|information is not currently included in the PCD TF.  There is mention of |
|it in the following sections:                                             |
|TF-1 (2.2.4) – This high-level overview is misplaced, since RTM is not    |
|strictly a Profile; a new content module section should be created        |
|TF-1 (Appendix A) – RTM Problem Statement & Key Use Case; this content    |
|should be moved to TF-3 (4.1)                                             |
|TF-2 (Appendix K) – Additional overview and background information about  |
|RTM, some of which is now dated with the public release of the NIST RTMMS |
|tool.                                                                     |
|None of these sections include the detailed specifications that define the|
|RTM design.  As noted, the information is also both dated and in some     |
|cases, not in the appropriate location.                                   |
|This CP updates the sections identified above as well as adds the detailed|
|information to TF-3 (4.1) to capture RTM detailed specifications.         |
