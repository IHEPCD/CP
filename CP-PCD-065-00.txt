      monitor, and alter the operating parametes of an implantable
      pacemaker, implantable defibrillator, or implantable cadiac
      resynchronization device, or implantable cardiac monitor.





Add to the Glossary the following:

    • Implantable Cardiac Monitor – An electronic device implanted beneath
      the skin for monitoring/recording the electrical signals of the heart
      muscle.
