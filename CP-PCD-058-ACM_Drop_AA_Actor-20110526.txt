                    Change Proposal Summary information:
|ACM CP Drop AA actor to improve TF integration potential                  |
|Submitter’s Name(s) and e-mail      |Monroe Pattillo, Philips Emergin,   |
|address(es):                        |monroe.pattillo@philips.com         |
|Submission Date:                    |2011-06-02                          |
|Integration Profile(s) affected:    |Alarm Communication Management (ACM)|
|Actor(s) affected:                  |Alarm Manager (AM), Alarm           |
|                                    |Communicator (AC)                   |
|IHE Technical Framework or          |Still a Supplement at Trial         |
|Supplement modified:                |Implementation Status, not yet in   |
|                                    |Technical Framework                 |
|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:  |Not applicable                      |
|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|After three Connectathons in which the ACM profile was included, the AA   |
|(Alarm Archiver) actor, and related PCD-08 and PCD-11 transactions, has   |
|yet to be verified in a Connectathon by AA and AM actor vendor            |
|implementations.  The absence of Connectathon verification of the AA actor|
|and related PCD-08 and PCD-11 transactions is a barrier to the integration|
|of the ACM Supplement into the PCD Technical Framework.                   |
|In order to increase the potential for the ACM Supplement to be integrated|
|into the PCD Technical Framework this CP drops from the Trial             |
|Implementation the AA actor and related PCD-08 and PCD-11 transactions    |
|between the AA and AM actors.                                             |
|Should demand for an AA-like actor arise in the future it can be added    |
|using CP to the Supplement or Technical Framework.                        |
|Alternatively an AA actor similar capability could be implemented through |
|vendors adopting the ADQ (Asynchronous Data Query) profile.               |
|                                                                          |


The individual line changes would be far too much to include in this CP
document.  Instead the editorial changes are listed below.

Remove from all diagrams, tables, and text references the…

      AA actor

      PCD-08 transaction

      PCD-11 transaction
