|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|The IEEE 11073 Domain Information Model (DIM) defines Alerts as including |
|both Alarms (Physiological and Technical) and Advisories.  IHE PCD defines|
|Events communicated between systems as being covered under a different    |
|profile from Alerts being communicated to people.                         |
|                                                                          |
|By defining ACM as Alarm Communication Management there is an assumption  |
|that the profile is only appropriate for the communication of Alarm type  |
|Alerts and that it would be inappropriate to use the profile to           |
|communicate Advisory type Alerts.  This is not the case.  The capabilities|
|and use cases defined in the ACM Trial Implementation are suitable for    |
|communication of either class of Alert:  an Alarm (Physiological or       |
|Technical), or an Advisory.  Use of priority by Advisories does not       |
|detract or alter the binding of urgency to alarm priority as defined in   |
|11073.                                                                    |
|As Alarm Communication Management (ACM) is too narrow to permit inclusion |
|of communication of Advisories then change it to Alert Communication      |
|Management (still ACM) and all acronym references for actors and other    |
|references from Alarm to Alert, e.g.                                      |
|Alarm Reporter (AR) becomes Alert Reporter (still AR)                     |
|Alarm Manager (AM) becomes Alert Manager (still AM)                       |
|Alarm Communicator (AC) becomes Alert Communicator (still AC)             |
|The transaction numbering is unchanged, but the names would be changed    |
|from … Alarm … to … Alert …, as in…                                       |
|PCD-04 Report Alarm would be PCD-04 Report Alert                          |
|PCD-06 Disseminate Alarm would be PCD-06 Disseminate Alert                |
|PCD-07 Report Dissemination Alarm Status would be PCD-07 Report           |
|Dissemination Alert Status                                                |
|As HL7 2.8 ballot defines ORU^R40 as Unsolicited Alert Observation Message|
|(Alert, not Alarm) with a description of…                                 |
|The R40 trigger event is used for observation reports that include an     |
|alertable condition, i.e., for which some timely human or application     |
|intervention in patient care may be indicated by the findings.            |
|There is no change in the event trigger to broaden the reach of ACM from  |
|Alarm to Alert.                                                           |
|The result is that the reach of the ACM (Alert Communication Management)  |
|profile is now broader and can be used for alerts other than alarms, such |
|as advisories.  This might make ACM more usable by other IHE domains for  |
|profiles that need a means of communication to people of alerts that are  |
|not alarms, e.g. advisories.                                              |
|In keeping with this broader reach of ACM (Alert Communication Management)|
|there is now a requirement for an additional Abnormal Flags indication of |
|SA to indicate Advisory instead of Alarm, with Alarm being the default.   |
|Examples in ACM TI to be adjusted accordingly.                            |
