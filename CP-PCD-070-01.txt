|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|There was confusion on what values should be contained in the OBX-5 fields|
|when the Value Type (OBX-2) is Coded With Exceptions (CWE). The Change    |
|Proposal clarifies the intended use of this field.                        |


Proposed Changes:

Replace the text defining the use of OBX-3 with the following:

OBX-3.1 Observation Identifier, Identifier shall be <Code> [numeric] as
defined in Annex C.3 ‘Expanded Terms’ of IEEE 11073-10103 (see 3.9.3
Referenced Standards).

OBX-3.2 Observation Identifier, shall be  <Reference ID> as defined in
Annex C.3 ‘Expanded Terms’ in IEEE 11073-10103 (see 3.9.3 Referenced
Standards)

OBX-3.3 Observation Identifier, Name of Coding System shall be MDC to
reference the group of medical device communication standards (IEEE 11073-
xxxxx)



Replace the text defining the use of OBX-5 with the following:

OBX-5 Observation Value – This is the actual value of the observation.

If OBX-2 is of type CWE then

  OBX-5.1 shall be <Code> [numeric] as defined in Annex D.3 ‘enumerations’
  or Annex E.3 ‘vendor enumerations’ of IEEE 11073-10103 (see 3.9.3
  Referenced Standards) .

  OBX-5.2 shall be  <Enumerator Identifier>_<EnumerationCode [mnemonic]> as
  defined in Annex D.3 ‘enumerations’ or Annex E.3 ‘vendor enumerations’ in
  IEEE 11073-10103 (see 3.9.3 Referenced Standards)

  OBX-5.3 shall be MDC to reference the group of medical device
  communication standards (IEEE 11073-xxxxx)

  OBX-5.9 can contain the according Display Name as defined in Annex D.3
  ‘enumerations’ or Annex E.3 ‘vendor enumerations’ of IEEE 11073-10103
  (see 3.9.3 Referenced Standard) or an equivalent (maybe more compact)
  localized display name. If the vendor has implemented vendor-specific
  extensions (per IEEE 11073-10103 Sections 8 and A.4) than OBX-5.9 is
  required.  This display name should only be used by the receiving system
  as a reference or if the Identifier in OBX-5.1 is unknown to the receiver
  (e.g. for proprietary vendor content). Generation and localization of
  display names in the receiving system shall always be preferred.




OBX-5 Observation Value – This is the actual value of the observation.




 If OBX-2 is of type CWE then

  OBX-5.1 shall be an enumeration code [mnemonic] as defined in Annex D.3
  ‘enumerations’ or Annex E.3 ‘vendor enumerations’ of IEEE 11073-10103
  version 1.05.02 (10/04/2011) and
  OBX-5.2 can contain the according display name as defined in Annex D.3
  ‘enumerations’ or Annex E.3 ‘vendor enumerations’ of IEEE 11073-10103
  version 1.05.02 (10/04/2011) or an equivalent display name in another
  language.
