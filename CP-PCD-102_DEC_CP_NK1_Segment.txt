|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|When transmitting information for a baby, minor, or elderly person where  |
|it is important to include information about a responsible party, use of  |
|the NK1 segment is needed to represent the information associated with the|
|responsible party. To address these use cases, the NK1 segment needs to be|
|Optional (O) and the cardinality needs to support zero or more responsible|
|parties.                                                                  |
|Previously, the DEC profile did not have a use case requiring this        |
|segment. Thus the DEC profile currently prohibits the use of the NK1      |
|segment. The EHDI profile has emerged with a use case where the NK1 is    |
|needed. The proposed change would thus allow the EHDI profile to require  |
|(RE) the use of this segment.                                             |

Revise Section 3.1.4.1.1 to make the following modification to Table
