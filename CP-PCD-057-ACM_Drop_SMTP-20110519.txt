                    Change Proposal Summary information:
|ACM CP Drop SMTP as AM to AC actor protocol option for PCD-06 and PCD-07  |
|transactions                                                              |

|Integration Profile(s) affected:    |Alarm Communication Management (ACM)|

|IHE Technical Framework or          |Still a Supplement at Trial         |
|Supplement modified:                |Implementation Status, not yet in   |
|                                    |Technical Framework                 |
|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:  |Not applicable                      |
|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|In 2010 modifications were approved to the ACM trial implementation       |
|supplement to permit and prefer use of the WCTP protocol for AM to AC     |
|actor communication for the PCD-06 and PCD-07 transactions.  The use of   |
|WCTP was verified at the 2011 Connecation with two AM and two AC          |
|implementations, no AM or AC vendors required use of the SMTP option,     |
|since it is the preference WCTP is to be the only accepted AM to AC       |
|communication protocol.  SMTP can now be removed from the ACM profile     |
|trial implementation and WCTP is the only choice the AM to AC protocol    |
|option can be removed from Gazelle before 2012 Connectathon registration. |
|                                                                          |


Line 215 page 8 table X.2-1 remove rows identifying SMTP as a protocol
option for AM to AC communications for the PCD-06 and PCD-07 transactions.
As WCTP is now the only accepted protocol for AM to AC communication,
remove the option from the ACM profile trial implementation and Gazelle
before Connectathon registration.
