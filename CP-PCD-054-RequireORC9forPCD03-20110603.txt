|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:  |Volume 2                            |
|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|To ensure messages being delivered from the IOP to the IOC are timely and |
|old transactions can be identified easily and without inturpretation it is|
|requested that the ORC-9 be required for all PCD-03 transactions.  The    |
|time in this field should be the time the clinician initiated the program |
|request, not the time the IOP generated the message.                      |

Replace Section B.9 lines 2177-2179 :
ORC-9 Date/Time of Transaction
      See HL7 V2.6 Section 4.5.1.9 for details. The PCD TF does not further
      constrain this field.

ORC-9 Date/Time of Transaction
      The time in this field should be the time the clinician initiated the
      program request, not the time the IOP generated the message.  The IOC
      may use this field to determine if the request is stale or too old.
