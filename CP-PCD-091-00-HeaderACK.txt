                    Change Proposal Summary information:

|Revise reference to MSH-15 and MSH-16 for PCD-01 in Appendix B.1 to state:|
|For MSH-15 “In PCD-01 transactions, this field shall be valued as AL”     |
|For MSH-16 “In PCD-01 transactions, this field shall be valued as NE”     |
|Remove the sentence “Note that the combination of MSH-16 valued as AL and |
|MSH-15 valued as NE is consistent with the original acknowledgement rules |
|used in other IHE TFs.”                                                   |

|Supplement modified:                |                                    |
|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:  |Volume 2, Appendix B.1 (and likely  |
|                                    |should be added to Section 3.1.4 in |
|                                    |a new MSH section)                  |
|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|The current text in Appendix B.1 states that MSH-15 should be “NE” and    |
|MSH-16 “AL” but this is inconsistent with the expected behavior for the   |
|DOC.                                                                      |
|If the DOC were to actually follow HL7 for these values, the DOC would    |
|send an enhanced ack back to the DOR on a separate port. From HL7: If the |
|message header segment indicates that the initiating system also requires |
|an application acknowledgment, this will be returned as the initial       |
|message of a later exchange.                                              |
|However, this is not the desired behavior at all, nor is this extra       |
|enhanced ack defined anywhere in the techincal framework for PCD-01       |
|messages.                                                                 |
|The expected behavior is actualy for the DOC to send back an Accept       |
|Acknowledgement, but since this TF states that the DOR sends NE/AL that   |
|Accept Acknowldgement ends up having to contain AA because that’s what the|
|Enhanced Acknowledgement’s value should be.                               |
|Appendix B should instead say that MSH-15 should be “AL” and MSH-16 “NE”  |
|to be consistent with what is actually expected by the DORs.              |


Appendix B of TF Volume 2 should be changed to require MSH-15 as AL and MSH-
16 as NE for PCD-01 transactions

Replace Section Appendix B.1 MSH-15 by the following:

MSH-15 Accept Acknowledgement Type

      Definition: This field identifies the conditions under which accept
      acknowledgments are required to be returned in response to this
      message. Required. Refer to HL7 Table 0155  Accept/application
      acknowledgment conditions for valid values. The receiving system must
      send (or not send) acknowledgements as specified by this field.

      In PCD-01 transactions, this field shall be valued as NEAL.

      In PCD-03 transactions, see Section 3.3.4.4.1

Replace Section Appendix B.1 MSH-16 by the following:
MSH-16 Application Acknowledgement Type

      Definition: This field identifies the conditions under which
      application acknowledgments are required to be returned in response to
      this message. Required for enhanced acknowledgment mode. Refer to HL7
      Table 0155 - Accept/application acknowledgment conditions for valid
      values. The PCD TF requires that this field be valued as ALNE for PCD-
      01. Note that the combination of MSH-16 valued as AL and MSH-15 valued
      as NE is consistent with the original acknowledgement rules used in
      other IHE TFs. The receiving system must send (or not send)
      acknowledgements as specified by this field.


      For PCD-03 transactions, see section 3.3.4.4.1
