|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|ACM makes use of IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature and 11073-10201 Domain     |
|Information Model (DIM) data object values and enumerations which it maps |
|to ACM PCD-04 transaction HL7 data items (segment fields, components,     |
|etc.).  ACM also adds values to communicate information not identified in |
|11073.  It may not be obvious to those unfamiliar with ACM PCD-04 use of  |
|HL7 as to which items would or would not be expected to be found in 11073.|
|The 11073 item usage by ACM should be more apparent and specifically      |
|indicating where ACM makes use of items which would not be found in 11073.|
|In particular…                                                            |
|                                                                          |
|ACM items mapped to 11073                                                 |
|ACM MDS in OBX-4 Sub-ID dot notation element 1 MDS position maps to 11073 |
|MDS with 11073 MDS value in OBX-5 Observation Value                       |
|                                                                          |

|ACM MDC_ATTR_ALARM_STATE in OBX-3 Observation Identifier with OBX-4 Sub-ID|
|dot notation element 5 FACET with value 4 whose value in OBX-4 Observation|
|Value enumerations of active, inactive, latched map to 11073 alarm states |

|                                                                          |
