Replace Section 3.3.4.4.9 with the following:



The Pharmacy/Treatment Give Message (RGV^O15^RGV_O15) is sent from the
Infusion Order Programmer to the Infusion Order Consumer.

The receiving system validates the message and responds with an accept
acknowledgment message (ACK^O15^ACK).  If an error condition is detected
and if MSH-16 (Application Acknowledgement Type) in the RGV^O15^RGV_O15
message is valued as "ER" or "AL", the IOC responds with a
Pharmacy/Treatment Give Acknowledgment Message (RRG^O16^RRG_O16).

If the message passes review is accepted by the IOC, the accept
acknowledgment will contain the value CA in MSA-1.  If not, the accept
acknowledgment will contain either CR or CE, based upon HL7 enhanced
acknowledgment rules (see HL7 v2.6, Section 2.9.3.2).

Message acceptance is based on:

    • All required segments and fields are present
    • No incorrect data types are present.
    • Validation of fields that must contain specific values as defined in
      the Technical Framework (e.g., MSH-21 must be
      "1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.6.1.3.1").

If MSH-16 (Application Acknowledgement Type) is valued as "ER" or "AL", the
IOC may report an application acknowledgement error using the
Pharmacy/Treatment Give Acknowledgement Message (RRG^O16^RRG_O16) for
errors such as:
    • Unknown device
    • Dose/rate and volume are not within vendor parameters for the device
      type.
    • Drug is not present in onboard library.

If the message from the Infusion Order Programmer is rejected, the
acknowledgement will contain the value AR or AE in MSA-1, based upon HL7
enhanced acknowledgment rules (see HL7 v2.6, Section 2.9.2.2).  The reason
for rejection is provided in the ERR segment.

Once the programming information is received by the pump, the clinician may
choose to do one
of the following: (1) confirm the settings on the pump and then start the
infusion, (2) enter or modify one or more settings and then start the
infusion, or (3) cancel the program altogether.

Once the infusion is started, the settings actually programmed as well as
the current state of the infusion can be obtained using the PCD-01
(Communicate PCD Data) transaction.
