|Implementors have found a lack of clarity on the normative requirements   |
|for OBX-4 content and what may vary per message source.  This lack of     |
|clarity can challenge the message consumer, which may be receiving        |
|messages from multiple sources of the same device modality.  Two key      |
|issues have been raised:                                                  |
|Are the values in OBX-4 for a specific device modality, information model |
|and parameter normative?  For example, if an infusion pump has a          |
|parameter, MDC_PUMP_INFUSING_STATUS, contained in the pump’s “delivery”   |
|channel, will the associated OBX-4 always have a (1) in the channel slot  |
|(e.g., <mds>|<vmd>|1|<param #>)?                                          |
|Can the OBX-4 containment values change from message-to-message, though   |
|they are sent from the same actor during a single session?                |
|The changes below add clarification to the text to answer these questions.|




Add the following section in Appendix A (before section A.1):

For example the OBX-4 for the <VS Mon> <ECG> <Ctach> <HR> would be
expressed as 1.2.1.3.

NOTE:  The ordinal numbers in an OBX-4 are not normative for a given
parameter (identified in OBX-3) and may vary between implementations.  Each
OBX-4 Sub-Id must be unique within a given containment and will not change
from message-to-message during a session with an individual device (for
example, during an infusion pump delivery).

In OBX-2 the valid HL7 types for the mapping are NM, ST, SN, CWE, CF
(String may have some implied structure)





Add the following section in Appendix B-8, OBX-4 subsection:

OBX-4   Observation Sub-ID

      This field shall be used to distinguish between multiple OBX segments
      and represent the hierarchical (containment) relations among the
      segments. It does so by providing an unambiguous mapping from
      observation contained in the OBX segment to the IEEE 11073 containment
      tree for the Medical Device System sourcing the observation (See
      Error! Reference source not found. Error! Reference source not
      found.). For device related data this field is used to group devices
      hierarchically. For metric related data this field is used to
      associate metrics to devices hierarchically, and to each other. The
      dotted notation provided for in HL7 Ch7, 7.4.2.4, Fig 4 shall be used
      as follows: <MDS>.<VMD>.<Channel>.<Metric> [.FACET [.SUBFACET]], where
      the optional facet and subfacet entries are used only when specified
      for a particular profile, and distinguish multiple information items
      related to the same metric according to a specific scheme documented
      with the particular profile. For device related data that convey
      information about hierarchical levels higher than METRIC (that is,
      information about an MDS, VMD, or Channel), the entries in the dotted
      notation concerning the lower dot-levels (that is, VMD, Channel or
      metric levels for an MDS, channel and METRIC for a VMD, and so forth)
      have no meaning and this should be signified by setting them to zero).
      So, for information relating to the first MDS, OBX-4 should be
      1.0.0.0. Receiving systems shall recognize from such trailing zeros in
      OBX-4 when the information applies to an MDS, VMD, or channel rather
      than a metric.

      This scheme allows the VMD, CHAN, METRIC and FACET information to be
      associated with ‘ancestor’ information higher up in the observation
      hierarchy. This is especially critical for devices like infusion pumps
      that have multiple channels with the same METRIC level identifiers.
      The scheme uses simple dotted decimal numeric identifiers where each
      number is a nonnegative integer. These must create unique n-tuples for
      each OBX. (That is, each OBX in a set grouped within the scope of an
      OBR segment must have a distinct value of OBX-4).

      The OBX-4 Sub-ID is not normative for a given metric (identified in
      OBX-3).  For example, an OBX-4 of 1.2.3.4 is not fixed to “heart
      rate.”  If a parameter is included in multiple places within a
      containment (i.e., OBX-3 has the same value), the OBX-4 Sub-ID will be
      unique between each instance.  Different systems may generate
      different OBX-4 identifiers for the same metric – the only requirement
      is that the OBX-4 uniquely identify each instance of a metric within a
      containment.  The Sub-ID sent by a given system related to a specific
      device instance will not change from message to message but will
      remain consistent during a session (e.g., during a single infusion
      pump delivery).

      The special value ‘0’ implies an ‘anonymous’ placeholder for the
      corresponding position in the containment hierarchy, for example an
      unspecified VMD and/or CHAN except when the '0' is part of a sequence
      of trailing '0' entries signifying that the dotted notation identifies
      data related to an MDS, VMD, or channel rather than a metric (see
      above).

      IEEE 11073-20601 for Personal Health Devices does not use the VMD or
      CHAN levels, e.g., 1.0.0.1 would be used for the observation hierarchy
      MDC_DEV_SPEC_PROFILE_ PULS_OXIM / VMD / CHAN /
      MDC_PULS_OXIM_PULS_RATE.

      The values of the 'dotted notations' of the OBX segments associated
      with a particular OBR (forming an ORDER_OBSERVATION segment group)
      establish a nested hierarchical arrangement representing the
      containment of lower-level within higher-level constructs (for
      example, all metric OBXes with a dotted notation beginning with '1.2'
      belong to the second VMD of the first MDS). This is exploited to
      support a form of inheritance for time stamps (see Section Error!
      Reference source not found. Error! Reference source not found.) so
      that, for example, a time stamp given in OBX-14 at the channel level
      applies to all metrics contained within that channel unless overridden
      by a time stamp in OBX-14 in the metric itself.

      To facilitate processing and use of this containment hierarchy, OBX
      segments should be arranged in "dictionary order" of dotted notations,
      meaning for example that all metrics belonging to the second channel
      should appear together in order of their metric-level element of the
      dotted notation (x.y.2.1, x.y.2.2, etc.) after any metrics belonging
      to the first channel (x.y.1.z) and before any metrics belonging to the
      third channel (x.y.3.z). Similarly, all OBX segments belonging to the
      second VMD should be placed before those belonging to the second, and
      so forth. This scheme may be used for '0' values in any position
      simply by inserting them in the sort order before '1' values (simple
      numeric sort within dot position). Note that this is not a simple
      string sort, because of the possibility that the numbers in a
      particular level may be more than a single digit long (e.g.,
      1.11.2.3).

      This ‘dictionary order’ should also be applied to device-related as
      well as to metric OBX segments: all MDS device-related segments for
      the first device should precede all VMD device-related segments for
      the first VMD of the first device, which in turn should precede any
      channel device-related segment(s) for the first channel, if any, of
      the first device (recall that channels are optional), and any channel
      segments should precede all the metric OBX segments of the first VMD
      and channel of the first device. The order goes to the second channel
      of the first VMD if any, and so on until the contents of all the
      channels of the first VMD have been given, then device-related
      segments for the second VMD, and so on in a similar fashion. (This is
      in effect a depth-first traversal of the 11073 “containment tree” of
      the objects in the device).
