|Updates where applied to the IEEE nomenclature which were not carried over|
|to the IHE profile where “MDC_IDC_PG_” was replaced with the more widely  |
|accepted “MDC_IDC_DEV_”. The abreviation PG was originally for ‘Pulse     |
|Generator’ however the working group agreed that DEV for ‘Device’ is more |
|appropriate.                                                              |


Proposed Changes:

Replace Section 3.9.4.1.2.2 (PID-3.1) by the following:

PID-3.1 Patient Identifier List

ID Number contains a unique identifier for the patient assigned by the
Implantable Device – Cardiac – Reporter. Identifier Type Code is
constrained by Table 0203 listed below (others can be included as defined
in the 2.6 standard). The first identifier will always be the unique
model/serial number of the implanted device with an identifier of type U
(see table following). This will be used by the Implantable Device –
Cardiac – Consumer / Repository actor to match the device interrogations
with the patient accounts. Assigning Authority will be a unique name of the
Implantable Device – Cardiac – Reporter system or owning organization that
creates the observation and will be coded using the MDC_IDC Nomenclature,
MDC_IDC_PGDEV_MFG term.





Replace Table 3.9.4.1.2.2-2 HL7 Table 0203 Row 1 with the following:
                     Table 3.9.4.1.2.2-2: HL7 Table 0203

|Code|Description              |Notes                     |Usage|
|U   |Model and Serial Number  |Model and Serial number   |R    |
|    |of Device                |will be concatenated      |     |
|    |IEEE 11073_10103         |together and will be      |     |
|    |MDC_IDC_PGDEV_MODEL and  |unique within an Assigning|     |
|    |MDC_IDC_PGDEV_SERIAL     |Authority.                |     |
|    |                         |The format of the ID will |     |
|    |                         |be following:             |     |
|    |                         |“model:xxx/serial:yyy”    |     |
|    |                         |Example:                  |     |
|    |                         |model:XZY987/serial:abc123|     |




Replace text in Table 3.9.4.1.2.5-1 Row 5 with the following:
                      Table 3.9.4.1.2.5-1: OBX Segment
Name |Seq |DT |Len |Opt |Rep |Min |Max |Tbl |Fixed Value |Ex Val | |   text
