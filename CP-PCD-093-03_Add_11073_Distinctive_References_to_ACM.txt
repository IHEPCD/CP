|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|ACM makes use of IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature and 11073-10201 Domain     |
|Information Model (DIM) data object values and enumerations which it maps |
|to ACM PCD-04 transaction HL7 data items (segment fields, components,     |
|etc.).  ACM also adds values to communicate information not identified in |
|11073.  It is not always clear to those not familiar with ACM PCD-04 use  |
|of HL7 which items would or would not be expected to be found in 11073.   |
|This CP would add specific 11073 references to the ACM TI and specifically|
|indicate where ACM makes use of items which would not be found in 11073.  |
|The following is the substances of the changes.                           |
|                                                                          |

|MDS with 11073 MDS value in OBX-5 Observation Value                       |
|                                                                          |
|ACM VMD in OBX-4 Sub-ID dot notation element 2 VMD position maps to 11073 |

|ACM METRIC in OBX-4 Sub-ID dot notation element 4 METRIC position maps to |

|                                                                          |
|ACM MDC_ATTR_ALARM_STATE in OBX-3 Observation Identifier with OBX-4 Sub-ID|
|dot notation element 5 FACET with value 4 whose value in OBX-4 Observation|
|Value enumerations of active, inactive, latched map to 11073 alarm states |
|of active, inactive, latched                                              |
|                                                                          |

|source identification, 3 for event phase, 4 for alert state (values for   |
|which are mapped from 11073) , 5 for inactivation state (values for which |
|are mapped from 11073), 6 for real-time location, and 7 for evidentiary   |
|data                                                                      |
