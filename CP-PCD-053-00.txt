|Rationale for Change:                                               |
|Added a new application error message for care area or profile      |
|mismatch; also add a more specific reference in the TF vol 2 (B.3   |
|ERR segment; ERR-5 section) about where the application error table |
|can be found on the IHE site (since this table is not included in   |
|the TF).                                                            |
|Added a Limitations section to Vol 1 including an explanation for   |
|how the PIV profile can support rate changes or titrations.         |
|Added a statement to Vol. 2 about the use of information in the     |
|PCD-03 transaction.                                                 |




Add the following row to the PIV application error  table (Table 0533
Application Error Code.  Insert a reference in Vol 2 about the existence
and location of this table (since it is not part of the TF).

|           |                                        |not cleared on pump;  |
|           |                                        |or pump is set to a   |

The following is a revision of text that was formerly contained in the Open
Issues section of the PIV supplement.  This text should be incorporated
into TF Vol 1 as a “Limitations” section.

Limitations


1.  The principal use case involves starting a new infusion or container.
Titrations or rate changes on a previously programmed infusion are
supported if one of the following applies:

   a) The Infusion Order Programmer is able to provide the amount of the
      volume currently present in the bag in the PCD-03 transaction (rather
      than the ordered volume)

   b) The BCMA application provides an acceptable workflow for the clinician
      to adjust the volume to be infused directly on the pump from the
      amount ordered to the amount currently present in the bag

   c) The Infusion Order Consumer is able to interpret the PCD-03
      transaction as a rate change without explicit identification as such
      (since there is no element in the transaction that refers to whether
      it is for a new bag vs. a rate change).

2.  Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion devices are not supported.

3.  The following therapies, modes, and methods of operation are not
supported:

   a) Bolus, loading dose, multi-step, periodically repeating or ramp/taper
      therapies

   b) Delayed start mode

   c) Programming concurrent or sequenced infusions on more than one pump
      channel using a single transaction

4.  PIV can be used to support administration of medications from a syringe
and/or using a syringe pump device if the Infusion Order Consumer does not
require the syringe size to be specified.





Add the following change toTF Vol 2 in Section 3.3.4.1

PCD-03 Communicate Infusion Order (RGV^O15^RGV_O15) static definition


The PCD-03 Communicate Infusion Order message is used to communicate
infusion data from an Infusion Order Programmer (IOP) to an Infusion Order
Consumer (IOC).

Since the IOC is typically a gateway rather than an infusion pump, all of
the information specified in the PCD-03 Communicate Infusion Order
transaction is not necessarily provided to or used to program the device.
