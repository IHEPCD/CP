|Currently PIV supports a single nursing workflow:  starting a new         |
|bag/bottle/container for an infusion order.  This change would provide    |
|support for another common workflow: changing the rate or dose of an      |
|infusion which is currently in progress.                                  |


Volume 1 (“Limitations” section to be added in Technical Framework v2.0 -
2012)

Limitations


1.  The principal use case involves starting a new infusion or container.
Titrations or rate changes on a previously programmed infusion are
supported if one of the following applies:

   a) The Infusion Order Programmer is able to provide the amount of the
      volume currently present in the bag in the PCD-03 transaction (rather
      than the ordered volume)

   b) The BCMA application provides an acceptable workflow for the clinician
      to adjust the volume to be infused directly on the pump from the
      amount ordered to the amount currently present in the bag

   c) The Infusion Order Consumer is able to interpret the PCD-03
      transaction as a rate change without explicit identification as such
      (since there is no element in the transaction that refers to whether
      it is for a new bag vs. a rate change).



Volume 1 - Glossary

Titration: a change of rate or dose on an infusion currently in progress.
Typically used for dose-based infusions, such as those ordered in mg/hr or
mcg/kg/min,  but can also apply to rate-based infusions, such as those
ordered in mL/hr.



Volume 2

B.9   ORC – Common Order Segment

ORC-1 Order Control

      Definition: Determines the function of the order segment. The PCD TF
      requires that this field be valued as RE RE or SC according to the
      table below when the RGV^O15^RGV_O15 Pharmacy/Treatment Give Message
      is used to send information from the Infusion Order Programmer (IOP)
      to the Infusion Order Consumer (IOC).

|ORC-1 Value|Use                                          |
|RE         |Start of a new bag, bottle, or container     |
|SC         |Change of dose or rate on a currently        |
|           |programmed infusion                          |


3.3.4.4.9 Expected Actions

The Pharmacy/Treatment Give Message (RGV^O15^RGV_O15) is sent from the
Infusion Order
Programmer to the Infusion Order Consumer.

The receiving system validates the message and responds with an accept
acknowledgment message (ACK^O15^ACK). If an error condition is detected and
if MSH-16 (Application
Acknowledgement Type) in the RGV^O15^RGV_O15 message is valued as "ER" or
"AL", the
IOC responds with a Pharmacy/Treatment Give Acknowledgment Message
(RRG^O16^RRG_O16).

If the message is accepted by the IOC, the accept acknowledgment will
contain the value CA in MSA-1. If not, the accept acknowledgment will
contain either CR or CE, based
upon HL7 enhanced acknowledgment rules (see HL7 v2.6, Section 2.9.3.2).

Message acceptance is based on:
• All required segments and fields are present
• No incorrect data types are present. Validation of fields that must
contain specific values as defined in the Technical Framework (e.g., MSH-21
must be "1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.6.1.3.1").

If MSH-16 (Application Acknowledgement Type) is valued as "ER" or "AL", the
IOC may
report an application acknowledgement error using the Pharmacy/Treatment
Give
Acknowledgement Message (RRG^O16^RRG_O16) for errors such as:
• Unknown device IHE Patient Care Device Technical Framework, Volume 2 (PCD
TF-2): Transactions
• Dose/rate and volume are not within vendor parameters for the device
type.
• Drug is not present in onboard library.


Messages containing “SC” in ORC-1 Order Control will not send the volume to
be infused information (RXG-5, RXG-7) to the pump; rather the pump will use
its current volume setting.

If the message from the Infusion Order Programmer is rejected, the
acknowledgement will
contain the value AR or AE in MSA-1, based upon HL7 enhanced acknowledgment
rules (see
HL7 v2.6, Section 2.9.2.2). The reason for rejection is provided in the ERR
segment.

Once the programming information is received by the pump, the clinician may
choose to do one
of the following: (1) confirm the settings on the pump and then start the
infusion, (2) enter or
modify one or more settings and then start the infusion, or (3) cancel the
program altogether.

Once the infusion is started, the settings actually programmed as well as
the current state of the
infusion can be obtained using the PCD-01 (Communicate PCD Data)
transaction.

Additional information related to this change proposal:

CP 740 submitted 12/11/2012 to HL7 Orders and Observations workgroup:

In HL7 v2.6 the definition of the RGV message states that the ORC must have
the filler order number and the order control code RE.  The CP provides for
the order control code SC (status changed) for an update to an continuous
administration (such as an IV fluid) that is currently in progress.
