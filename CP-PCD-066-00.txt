|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:  |Volume 2 (PCD TF-2); 3.9 (various   |

|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|Update the specified HL7 version from 2.5 to 2.6. This is required to     |
|bring the IDCO profile in-line with other Patient Care Device profiles    |
|with the goal for Consummers to simplify implementation similar to other  |
|profiles.                                                                 |


Proposed Changes:

Replace Section 3.9.3 by the following and add Note:

3.9.3 Referenced Standard


HL7 Messaging Standard v2.56

NOTE – The IDCO is functional with HL7 Messaging Standard v2.5. The only
change required is when specifying in the message header which version is
being used.

ISO 19005-1. Document management – Electronic document file format for long-
term preservation – Part 1: Use of PDF (PDF/A)

UCUM: Unified Code for Units of Measure, Regenstrief Institute for Health
Care, Indianapolis 2005. Version 1.6

IEEE 11073_10103-2012 Standard for Health informatics - Point-of-care
medical device communication - Nomenclature - Implantable device, cardiac

Replace Section 3.9.4.1 by the following:

3.9.4.1 HL7 ORU Observation


This is a standard HL7 v2.56 unsolicited orders and observation message
containing the observations taken by the implanted device.  Information is
coded using the IEEE 11073-10103 IDC Nomenclature.





Replace Section 3.9.4.1.2 by the following:

3.9.4.1.2 Message Semantics


The message is an unsolicited v2.56 ORU message from the Implantable Device
– Cardiac – Reporter to the Implantable Device – Cardiac – Consumer with a
corresponding ACK message back to the Implantable Device – Cardiac –
Reporter. The contents of the message (in OBX segments) are a required set
of individual observations or measurements trans-coded into separate HL7
v2.56 OBX segments and an optional encapsulated PDF document.

Refer to the HL7 v2.56 Standard, Chapter 7 ORU Message for general message
semantics.

The constrained message structure is given in Table 3.9.4.1.2-1, with
additional details provided in sections below.





Replace Section 3.9.4.1.2.2 (PID-3.1) by the following:

PID-3.1 Patient Identifier List

ID Number contains a unique identifier for the patient assigned by the
Implantable Device – Cardiac – Reporter. Identifier Type Code is
constrained by Table 0203 listed below (others can be included as defined
in the 2.56 standard). The first identifier will always be the unique
model/serial number of the implanted device with an identifier of type U
(see table following). This will be used by the Implantable Device –
Cardiac – Consumer / Repository actor to match the device interrogations
with the patient accounts. Assigning Authority will be a unique name of the
Implantable Device – Cardiac – Reporter system or owning organization that
creates the observation and will be coded using the MDC_IDC Nomenclature,
MDC_IDC_DEV_MFG term.
