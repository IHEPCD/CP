|Supplement modified:                |Revision X.X, published October 16, |

|Volume(s) and Section(s) affected:  |Volume 2, Section 3.3.4.4.7         |
|Rationale for Change:                                                     |
|This CP addresses the following issues with the RXR segment:              |
|Because the ‘Usage’ and ‘Cardinality’ attributes of RXR-3 (Administration |
|Device) in the PIV Supplement were inconistent, this field was mistakenly |
|identified as required in the Final Text, and should be changed to ‘RE’,  |
|with the cardinality changed appropriately.                               |
|The RXR-4 (Adminstration Method) field is currently only required when the|
|order is for an IV piggyback or secondary infusion.  This change proposal |
|makes the field always required, and defines the value to be used when the|
|order is for a primary infusion.                                          |
|There are three fields in the RXR segment which an IOP must populate from |
|among a fixed set of values.  In each case, the data type for the field is|
|CWE.  The values cited in the Technical Framework for these fields are not|
|formatted as CWE; this change proposal corrects the format for those      |
|values.                                                                   |
|This change proposal explicitly identifies values that must be added to   |
|the user-defined tables associated with RXR-3 (Administration Device) and |
|RXR-4 (Administration Method).                                            |


Proposed Changes:



Modify the ‘Usage’ and ‘Card.’ column values for the RXR segment in Table
3.3.4.4.7-1 as follows (changes are in bold):


   Table 3.3.4.4.7-1 HL7 Attribute Table – RXR – Pharmacy/Treatment Route
|SEQ   |LEN    |DT   |Usage  |Card. |TBL#    |ITEM #  |ELEMENT NAME          |

|      |       |     |       |]     |        |        |                      |

|      |       |     |       |      |        |        |Modifier              |


Modify the description of the definition of the ‘RXR-1 Route’ field in
Section 3.3.4.4.7 as follows (changes are in bold):



      Definition:  This field is the route of administration. The PCD TF
      requires that this field be valued as IV ^IV^HL70162.



Modify the description of the definition of the ‘RXR-3 Administration
Device’ field in Section 3.3.4.4.7 as follows (changes are in bold):



      Definition: Definition: This field contains the type of pump used to
      administer the drug, if known by the BCMA system. The PCD TF requires
      that this field be valued as IVP ^IVP^HL70164 for general infusion
      devices or SYR ^SYR^HL70164 for syringe pump devices, if the type of
      pump is known.

      The following entry should be added to user-defined table #0164:




      |Value                            |Description                       |
|SYR                              |Syringe Pump                      |



Modify the description of the definition of the ‘RXR-4 Administration
Method’ field in Section 3.3.4.4.7 as follows (changes are in bold):



      Definition: This field identifies whether the infusion is to be
      administered as a primary infusion or as an IV piggyback or secondary
      infusion.  When this is the case, the TF requires that this field be
      valued as IVPB.  The TF requires that this field be valued as
      ^IV^HL70165 for a primary infusion or ^IVPB^HL70165 for an IV
      piggyback or secondary infusion.

      The following entry should be added to user-defined table #0165:




      |Value                            |Description                       |
|IV                               |IV Primary                        |
